# Temp Vault

Temp Vault is made for individuals who frequently use their phone to take photos but do not require long-term storage of these photos. It is particularly useful for those who need to capture images for immediate or short-term reference, such as documents or quick visual notes, eliminating the need for manual cleanup later.
